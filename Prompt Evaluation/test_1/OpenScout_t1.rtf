However, we kindly request you to stick to the suggested 200mm & 300mm 20x20 aluminum extrusions, to allow other users disassemble their current configuration and try out yours! If you use OpenScout for your project, please open a PR with your configuration and tutorials. The general process of contributing on GitHub is widely documented however the outline process is below: 1. Identify where you want to host the project locally. This could be a OpenScout projects folder for example. 1. Clone or fork the repository using GitHub desktop or the CLI into this location (CLI is recommended as this helps you become more familiar with Git in general). You can do this with the following command: ```bash git clone {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/cbedio/OpenScout"}}{\fldrslt \ul \strokec3 https://github.com/cbedio/OpenScout}} ``` 1. Update the project and then make a pull request!",\
