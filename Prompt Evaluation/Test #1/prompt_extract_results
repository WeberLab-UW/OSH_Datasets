If you use OpenScout for your project, please open a PR with your configuration and tutorials. The general process of contributing on GitHub is widely documented however the outline process is below: 1. Identify where you want to host the project locally. This could be a OpenScout projects folder for example. 1. Clone or fork the repository using GitHub desktop or the CLI into this location (CLI is recommended as this helps you become more familiar with Git in general). You can do this with the following command: git clone https://github.com/cbedio/OpenScout 1. Update the project and then make a pull request!",
