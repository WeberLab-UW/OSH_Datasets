\
--- REASONING ---\
 1. License Information \'96 The README explicitly states that the project uses multiple licenses (\'93GNU General Public License v3.0\'94, \'93CERN-OHL-W\'94, and \'93CC BY-SA\'94) with direct links (to LICENSE, LICENCE, CC-BY-SA_LICENCE), which clearly qualifies as Explicit license information with strong evidence.  \
\
2. Contributing Guidelines \'96 The \'93How to contribute\'94 section provides step\uc0\u8208 by\u8208 step instructions (including forking, cloning, updating, and submitting a pull request) that are detailed enough. Although there is no separate CONTRIBUTING file, the guidelines are explicitly described in the README and meet a detailed level. Thus, this qualifies as Level 3.  \
\
3. Bill of Materials \'96 The \'93Getting started\'94 section briefly lists materials such as 200mm & 300mm aluminum extrusions, a specific motor (with an encoder) and an Arduino Mega. It is not presented as a complete table or detailed component list but does mention identifiers and some quantities (like \'934 of them\'94 for motors implied). This is best classified as Basic.  \
\
4. Assembly Instructions \'96 The README points to an external assembly tutorial (\'93OpenScout robot with 'Lazy Susan' revolute hinge\'94) and an external fully annotated Assembly Manual in PDF format. This indication that assembly instructions are available as an external referenced guide classifies it as Referenced.  \
\
5. Design Files \'96 The provided directory structure shows a \'93Documentation/CAD_Files\'94 folder with a variety of design files (.dxf and .step, among others) plus references to technical drawings (PDF). Based on the provided criteria, these are correctly identified as CAD Files (with specific file extensions) and Other types (such as PDF files).  \
\
Each category is assigned a confidence score based on the clarity and explicitness of the evidence.\
