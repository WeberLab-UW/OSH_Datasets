1851,CA000025,Nicholas Vandewetering,Canada,nvandew@uwo.ca,Open-Source Vertical Swinging Wood-Based Solar Photovoltaic Racking Systems,https://www.mdpi.com/2411-9660/7/2/34,1.0,"Vertical bifacial solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems offer the opportunity for large-scale agrivoltaics to be employed at farms producing field crops with conventional farming equipment. Unfortunately, commercial proprietary vertical racks cost more than all types of conventional PV farm racking solutions. To overcome these cost barriers, this study reports on the development of a new wood-based PV racking design. The open-source design consists of a hinge mechanism, which reduces mechanical loading and enables wood to be used as the main structural material, and is the first of its kind. This open-source vertical wood-based PV rack is (i) constructed from locally accessible (domestic) renewable and sustainable materials, (ii) able to be made with hand tools by the average farmer on site, (iii) possesses a 25-year lifetime to match PV warranties, and (iv) is structurally sound, following Canadian building codes to weather high wind speeds and heavy snow loads. The results showed that the capital cost of the racking system is less expensive than the commercial equivalent and all of the previous wood-based rack designs, at a single unit retail cost of CAD 0.21. The racking LCOE is 77% of the cost of an equivalent commercial racking system using retail small-scale component costs, and is 22%, 34%, and 38% less expensive than commercial metal vertical racking, wood fixed tilt racking, and wood seasonal tilt racking costs, respectively. Overall, wooden vertical swinging PV racking provides users with a low-cost, highly available alternative to conventional metal vertical racking, along with a potential increase in energy yield in high wind areas thanks to its unique swinging mechanism.",Science,"['Agriculture', 'Electronics', 'Environmental', 'Tool', 'Other']","['agrivoltaics', ' biomaterials', ' open source', ' mechanical design', ' photovoltaic', ' racking', ' renewable energy', ' solar energy', ' wood']",[],https://osf.io/qd4ca/,CERN-OHL-S-2.0,CERN-OHL-S-2.0,CERN-OHL-S-2.0,2023-03-03T00:00-05:00,

POSCAS is an adapted cold-frame that is normally used for gardening in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. The systems are parametric so they can be adapted for any size of PV module and designed to take advantage of distributed manufacturing. In addition, the thickness of the walls, type of wall insulation, possessing a floor or being directly located on the ground, the tilt angle of the module can all eb controlled by a parametric OpenSCAD script. The script outputs a 3-D printable file (STL) so the frame body can be manufactured from any waste plastic using distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM). POSCAS can both function as a traditional cold frame but it can also be automated with a temperature sensor, open source Arduino, fan and/or a motor to control air inflow into the greenhouse box. It can also be coupled to any number of other sensors to automate the care of the plants by controlling irrigation and fertilization. The PV module can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing, agricultural and power production. POSCAS can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV with thin film or crystalline silicon-based modules.  The percent transparency of the modules can be tested in a bank of POSCASs by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material, the various forms of optical enhancement and anti-reflection coatings or the density of silicon-based cells in the module. For example, they can be used to optimize Heliene greenhouse solar panels for specific crops.  Such Heliene red modules can have different transparencies by adjusting the density of the crystalline-silicon based cells. They are bifacial modules, which contain an energy-producing photovoltaic cells that generates electricity both from the top where the sunlight strikes it and from any reflection coming from underneath, and a red back-sheet. The back sheet transforms the green light spectrum into red before reaching the plants in the POSCAS below, while at the same time reflecting it back to the photovoltaic cell, which turns it into electricity that can be used in the greenhouse. The active materials that are in the back sheet can also be tested by the POSCAS (e.g. testing the density, size and chemical makeup of nanoparticles responsible for the solar light spectral shifting). All of these variables can be used to identify ideal PV designs for a given agricultural crop. This includes experimentally verifying the albedo from the crops and their impact on the different types of partially-transparent bifacial PV modules.",Agriculture,['Agriculture'],['additive manufacturing; agriculture; agrivoltaic; distributed manufacturing; farming; gardening; open hardware; photovoltaic; recycling; solar energy'],[],https://osf.io/k6xwv/,CERN-OHL-P-2.0,No software,CC BY,2021-11-12T00:00-05:00,
