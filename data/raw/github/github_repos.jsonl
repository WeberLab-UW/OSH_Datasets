{"repository":{"owner":"Junes-PhD","name":"Pole_Mounted_Bus_Tracker","full_name":"Junes-PhD/Pole_Mounted_Bus_Tracker","description":"The ultimate goal is get more bus trackers at each stop to make public transportation better.  In Chicago there are some displays are larger bus sheds but there is not any on neighborhood routes. People with internet enabled phones can use the tracking app but it's this doesn't help people without internet plans, and tourists.   The first prototype will be design for a person to build and attached a pole mounted bus tracker to their local bus station to make it easier to predict bus arrivals.  Since the device will be mounted outdoors and active all the time,  other users of the bus stop will benefit from the initial installation.  The installer will be responsible to maintenance and charging so there is not a central authority who has to make sure everything is working properly.   The second iteration will focus on a larger scale install and less individual maintenance.

The first prototype will be design for a person to build and attached a pole mounted bus tracker to their local bus station to make it easier to predict bus arrivals.  Since the device will be mounted outdoors and active all the time,  other users of the bus stop will benefit from the initial installation.  The installer will be responsible to maintenance and charging so there is not a central authority who has to make sure everything is working properly.   The second iteration will focus on a larger scale install and less individual maintenance.

However, it was reported to use pressure and optical sensors. Therefore, terminal blocks were fixed for possible modifications and process validations.
