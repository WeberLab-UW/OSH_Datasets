It is a nifty charger chip which has a lot of flexibility for different kinds of batteries (LiPoly, LiIon or LiFePO4), charging rates (250mA, 500mA, or 1A) and power sources (USB, DC or solar). To let folks really explore what this chip can do, we made a basic breakout board with all the things we find most useful: two ways to power/charge including a solar-friendly DC input, adjustable current and voltage, power path management, and status and control I/O.",

This chip handles all the motor and speed controls over I2C. Only two pins (SDA & SCL) are required to drive the multiple motors, and since it's I2C you can also connect any other I2C devices or HATs to the same pins.

That makes it great for panel-mounted projects, particularly since we've also got some space for 3 buttons to go along. It's like an all-in-one display interface dev board, powered by the fantastic ESP32-S2 WIFI module. This feather has a 4-pin Sparkfun Qwiic-compatible connector called STEMMA QT, which allows it to communicate over I2C without soldering. Click the link labeled 'Project Website' to find out more.",

Power the solenoids with a DC power supply in the center terminal blocks, you can use 3V to 24V DC maximum. Then wire up each solenoid to the remaining terminal blocks. The positive side will tie to the power supply you provided, and then the negative side will connect to ground when activated. Each solenoid has its own pass transistor AO3406 N-Channel MOSFET rated for 30Vds, 3.6A peak, and 70m ohm RdsOn. A flyback diode protects your circuit from the inductive kick-back, and a red LED will light up to let you know that the transistor is on.",

Snap in your Spark and upload the NeoPixel library code to light up the LEDs. Each LED is addressable as the driver chip is inside the LED. Each one has ~18mA constant current drive so the color will be consistent even if the voltage varies, and no external choke resistors are required. Power the whole thing with a ~3.5-5.5 VDC battery pack. Click the link labeled &#x27;Project Website&#x27; to find out more.",

We call them NeoPixels, since the part number itself can change quite a bit, but all have the same idea: send color data to lights and they'll change on their own without having to constantly PWM three or four diodes. Despite this simplicity, we've seen folks struggle with them because of voltage level expectations: some NeoPixel-compatible pixels are very picky and want 5V logic level. Without the right voltage, you get flickering or weird behavior. There's also some funky variants like the TM1814 that want inverted signal levels.",

In between are two 10K pullup resistors from the two I2C SDA/SCL lines to the positive power pin, plus a green ON LED so you know when the power pin and ground are properly wired.",

We kept the design compact, and it even has adjustable output pots, so you can tune the voltages from about +6~+15VDC and -6~15VDC. Perfect for use with audio or retro projects now that transformer supplies are hard to get, or if you want to have something that could run on battery or USB.",

Many AT interface devices use 3.5mm audio jacks to create switches or variable inputs - often mono TS or stereo TRS plugs. On the TRRS Trinkey, we connect all 6 pins of a 'switched' TRRS jack - tip, ring 1, ring 2, sleeve and the tip switch plus ring 1 switch - to 6 GPIO pins on the microcontroller. That means we can not only detect when plugs are inserted but can change which pins are input, ground or even 3V power. With the use of a stereo/mic splitter, we can have up to 3 simple switches, or two analog potentiometers, or one of each! We particularly like this jack because it has two through-hole contacts near the opening for a good mechanical connection.",

        "projectDescription": "Seeking to characterize and mitigate the negative effects of misalignment in WPT applications, we present the design and construction of a low-cost wireless charger prototype and a novel phase-shift measurement system. The first is built using a half-bridge inverter and antennas with series-series compensation, while a microcontroller (Teensy 4.1) supplies high-frequency PWM signals. The measurement unit comprises high-speed operational amplifiers and an exclusive OR gate. A resistor was used as a load. As is well known, the maximum power transfer occurs at the resonance frequency, nevertheless, this depends physically on the geometry of the coupling system. Using a 3D-printed displacement system, we created controlled vertical misalignments between the coils, thereby obtaining variations in the resonance frequency of the system and consequently, producing a proportional phase shift between the voltage and current waves of the transmitting antenna. As the experimental results demonstrate, the measurement system is capable of processing and monitoring this high-frequency phase shift and subsequently used it as a control variable in a proportional-integral controller, which adjusts the operation frequency of the system and brings it back to optimal conditions. This precise yet inexpensive (USD 170) implementation could find its application in EVs and biomedical devices\u2019 efficient wireless chargers.",

        "projectVersion": "1.0",
        "projectDescription": "Vertical bifacial solar photovoltaic (PV) racking systems offer the opportunity for large-scale agrivoltaics to be employed at farms producing field crops with conventional farming equipment. Unfortunately, commercial proprietary vertical racks cost more than all types of conventional PV farm racking solutions. To overcome these cost barriers, this study reports on the development of a new wood-based PV racking design. The open-source design consists of a hinge mechanism, which reduces mechanical loading and enables wood to be used as the main structural material, and is the first of its kind. This open-source vertical wood-based PV rack is (i) constructed from locally accessible (domestic) renewable and sustainable materials, (ii) able to be made with hand tools by the average farmer on site, (iii) possesses a 25-year lifetime to match PV warranties, and (iv) is structurally sound, following Canadian building codes to weather high wind speeds and heavy snow loads. The results showed that the capital cost of the racking system is less expensive than the commercial equivalent and all of the previous wood-based rack designs, at a single unit retail cost of CAD 0.21. The racking LCOE is 77% of the cost of an equivalent commercial racking system using retail small-scale component costs, and is 22%, 34%, and 38% less expensive than commercial metal vertical racking, wood fixed tilt racking, and wood seasonal tilt racking costs, respectively. Overall, wooden vertical swinging PV racking provides users with a low-cost, highly available alternative to conventional metal vertical racking, along with a potential increase in energy yield in high wind areas thanks to its unique swinging mechanism.",

        "projectDescription": "We propose an upgraded version of our previously designed open-source lipid bilayer amplifier. This improved amplifier is now suitable both for the use in introductory courses in biophysics and neurosciences at the undergraduate level and for scientific research. Similar to its predecessor, the OpenPicoAmp-100k is designed using the common lithographic printed circuit board fabrication process and off-the-shelf electronic components. It consists of the high-speed headstage, followed by voltage-gain amplifier with built-in 6-order Bessel filter. The amplifier has a bandwidth of 100 kHz in the presence of 100 pF input membrane capacitance and is capable of measuring ion channel current with amplitudes from sub-pA and up to \u00b14 nA. At the full bandwidth and with a 1 G\u03a9 transimpedance gain, the amplifier shows 12 pArms noise with an open input and 112 pArms noise in the presence of 100 pF input capacitance, while at the 5 kHz bandwidth (typical in single-channel experiments) noise amounts to 0.45 pArms and 2.11 pArms, respectively. Using an optocoupler circuit producing TTL-controlled current impulses and using 50% threshold analysis we show that at full bandwidth the amplifier has deadtimes of 3.5 \u00b5s and 5 \u00b5s at signal-to-noise ratios(SNR) of 9 and 1.7, respectively. Near 100% of true current impulses longer than 5 \u00b5s and 6.6 \u00b5s are detected at these two respective SNRs, while false event detection rate remains acceptably low. The wide bandwidth of the amplifier was confirmed in bilayer experiments with alamethicin, for which open ion channel current events shorter that 10 \u00b5s could be resolved.",

For this reason, we have built an open-source turbidity sensor that brings accessibility to global river research. Compared to commercial turbidity sensors (6000EUR), our low-cost version (200EUR) allows for multiple deployment and therefore a high spatial coverage of sediment fluxes. It is an optical scatter sensor with an 850nm LED and two IR detectors, and features a temperature and pressure sensor. Our sensor is 3D-printed on a hobby printer and is programmed with Arduino IDE, making it accessible to those without high-tech workshop access and limited programming skills. It features a printed circuit board that stacks on top of an ultra low-power Arduino MKR WAN 1310, for durability and easy assembly.",

        "projectDescription": "This invention is a parametric open-source smart cold-frame agrivoltaic system (POSCAS). POSCAS is an adapted cold-frame that is normally used for gardening in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. The systems are parametric so they can be adapted for any size of PV module and designed to take advantage of distributed manufacturing. In addition, the thickness of the walls, type of wall insulation, possessing a floor or being directly located on the ground, the tilt angle of the module can all eb controlled by a parametric OpenSCAD script. The script outputs a 3-D printable file (STL) so the frame body can be manufactured from any waste plastic using distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM). POSCAS can both function as a traditional cold frame but it can also be automated with a temperature sensor, open source Arduino, fan and/or a motor to control air inflow into the greenhouse box. It can also be coupled to any number of other sensors to automate the care of the plants by controlling irrigation and fertilization. The PV module can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing, agricultural and power production. POSCAS can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV with thin film or crystalline silicon-based modules.  The percent transparency of the modules can be tested in a bank of POSCASs by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material, the various forms of optical enhancement and anti-reflection coatings or the density of silicon-based cells in the module. For example, they can be used to optimize Heliene greenhouse solar panels for specific crops.  Such Heliene red modules can have different transparencies by adjusting the density of the crystalline-silicon based cells. They are bifacial modules, which contain an energy-producing photovoltaic cells that generates electricity both from the top where the sunlight strikes it and from any reflection coming from underneath, and a red back-sheet. The back sheet transforms the green light spectrum into red before reaching the plants in the POSCAS below, while at the same time reflecting it back to the photovoltaic cell, which turns it into electricity that can be used in the greenhouse. The active materials that are in the back sheet can also be tested by the POSCAS (e.g. testing the density, size and chemical makeup of nanoparticles responsible for the solar light spectral shifting). All of these variables can be used to identify ideal PV designs for a given agricultural crop. This includes experimentally verifying the albedo from the crops and their impact on the different types of partially-transparent bifacial PV modules.",

The sensor has a digital output that indicates when the magnetic flux density threshold has been crossed. The device integrates a Hall effect element, analog signal conditioning, and a low-frequency oscillator that enables ultra-low average power consumption. By operating from a 1.65-V to 5.5-V supply, the device periodically measures magnetic flux density, updates the output, and enters a low-power sleep state. The breakout comes with a 3-pin header for breadboard use. This board has a simple plug-and-play JST PH (2mm pitch) 3-pin input connector for solderless use. This cable is sold separately and is not needed to use the board.",

The processor board can then instruct the power board to put the entire sm\u00f4l stack into deep sleep for a pre-defined interval. Sleep intervals of 10's of milliseconds to several days are possible. In deep sleep, the only device left powered is the ATtiny841 and that reduces the current draw to 6\u00b5A.",

You can even program the Thing through the Arduino IDE by installing the updated ESP32 Arduino Core.\r\n\r\nThe ESP32 Thing plus integrates a rich set of peripherals, ranging from capacitive touch sensors, SD card interface, Ethernet, high-speed SPI, UART, I2S and I2C. Thanks to the onboard ESP32 WROOM module, the SparkFun Thing Plus features 16MB of flash memory, 520kB of internal SRAM, an integrated 802.11 BGN WiFi transceiver and dual-mode Bluetooth capabilities, a JST connector to plug in a LiPo battery, and a U.FL connector for your own antenna.",

If you need more I/O pins, you can easily connect any port expander, like the PCF8574 to the board's I2C bus. The board itself requires a 3.3V power supply, but all broken out I/Os are 5V tolerant.",
